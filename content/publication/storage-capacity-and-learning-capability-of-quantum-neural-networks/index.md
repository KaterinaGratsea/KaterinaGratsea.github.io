abstract: We study the storage capacity of quantum neural networks (QNNs)
  described as completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) maps, which act on an
  N-dimensional Hilbert space. We demonstrate that QNNs can store up to N
  linearly independent pure states and provide the structure of the
  corresponding maps. While the storage capacity of a classical Hopfield network
  scales linearly with the number of neurons, we show that QNNs can store an
  exponential number of linearly independent states. We estimate, employing the
  Gardner program, the relative volume of CPTP maps with M stationary states.
  The volume decreases exponentially with M and shrinks to zero for Mâ‰¥N+1. We
  generalize our results to QNNs storing mixed states as well as input-output
  relations for feed-forward QNNs. Our approach opens the path to relate storage
  properties of QNNs to the quantum properties of the input-output states. This
  paper is dedicated to the memory of Peter Wittek.
