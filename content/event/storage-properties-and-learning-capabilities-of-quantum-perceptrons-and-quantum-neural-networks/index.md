title: Storage properties and learning capabilities of (quantum perceptrons) and
  quantum neural networks
abstract: "Here, we investigate the storage capacity of a particular quantum
  perceptron architecture by using statistical mechanics techniques and connect
  our analysis to the theory of classical spin glasses. We focus on a specific
  quantum perceptron model and explore its storage properties in the limit of a
  large number of inputs. Next, we study the storage capacity of quantum neural
  networks (QNNs), described by completely positive trace preserving (CPTP) maps
  acting on an N-dimensional Hilbert space. For n qubits, QNNs can reach an
  exponential storage capacity, $\\mathcal{O}({2}^{n})$, clearly outperforming
  standard classical neural networks whose storage capacity scales linearly with
  the number of neurons n. We estimate, employing the Gardner program, the
  relative volume of CPTP maps with M ⩽ N stationary states and show that this
  volume decreases exponentially with M and shrinks to zero for M ⩾ N + 1. "
