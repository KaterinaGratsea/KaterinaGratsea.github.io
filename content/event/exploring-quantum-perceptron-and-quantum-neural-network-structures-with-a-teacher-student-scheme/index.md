title: Exploring Quantum Perceptron and Quantum Neural Network structures with a
  teacher-student scheme
abstract: >-
  Near-term quantum devices can be used to build quantum machine learning
  models,

  such as quantum kernel methods and quantum neural networks (QNN) to perform

  classification tasks. There have been many proposals on how to use variational quantum

  circuits as quantum perceptrons or as QNNs. The aim of this work is to systematically

  compare different QNN architectures and to evaluate their relative expressive power

  with a teacher-student scheme. Specifically, the teacher model generates the datasets

  mapping random inputs to outputs which then have to be learned by the student

  models. This way, we avoid training on arbitrary data sets and allow us to compare

  the learning capacity of different models directly via the loss, the prediction map, the

  accuracy and the relative entropy between the prediction maps. We focus particularly

  on a quantum perceptron model inspired by the recent work of Tacchino et. al. [1] and

  compare it to the data re-uploading scheme that was originally introduced by PerezSalinas et. al. [2]. We discuss alterations of the perceptron model and the formation

  of deep QNN to better understand the role of hidden units and non-linearities in these

  architectures.
